# Travel-Products
This is a react-context app.\
This project was conducted in Visual Studio Code with Javascript(babel) environment.\
The code for this project was divided into two parts: client and server.


\(1) CLIENT\
client is the customer who purchases a travel product from server. \
client could be activated with command in terminal prompt: "npm run start"\
client src also has three semi parts: pages, components, context

pages -> CompletePage, OrderPage, SummaryPage\
components -> ErrorBanner, Options, Products, Type\
context -> OrderContext

By ordering products, client can check the data from each product saved in directory.


\(2) SERVER\
Server is the seller who sells a travel product to client.\
Server could be activated with command in terminal prompt: "npm run start"


\It is effectively like a skeleton code.\
You can freely customize the travel products app by adding css styling.
